I no longer hold the private part of the key you know about.  (I lost
the dongle holding it.).  Therefore my public key should be invalidated.

I have generated a new keypair whose public key is

{"keytype":"ed25519","keyval":{"public":"ZI8di3a9Un0s2RBrt5GwVRvfOXVuywADfXGPZfkiDb0="}}

The private key is burned to a CD-ROM that is stored in a folder with
other CD-ROMs in my home office.  (You don't need to know this, but
when I need to find it again, this email will tell me where to look.)
It~is not stored on any hard drive, so it should be secure.

What I understand about the signing process is this:

  - If and when I sign the root info, I will be promising that
    I believe the root keys listed do belong to the people that are
    claimed to own them, which I will verify by checking gpg-signed
    emails. 

  - If and when I sign an operational key it will be because I believe
    the key is being issued to someone authorized to operate the
    hackage servers, again as verified by gpg-signed emails.
